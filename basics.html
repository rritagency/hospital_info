          <p>Understanding basic first aid techniques is not just about potentially saving lives in critical situations; it's about
             empowering individuals to respond effectively to emergencies. By acquiring first aid skills, individuals can play a 
             crucial role in reducing recovery time and minimizing the severity of injuries or illnesses. For instance, knowing how
              to perform CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) can significantly increase the chances of survival in cases of cardiac
               arrest, maintaining blood circulation and oxygenation until professional medical help arrives. Similarly, being able
                to administer first aid for a broken bone, such as immobilizing the injury with a splint, can prevent further damage
                 and facilitate the healing process. Moreover, the ability to offer immediate aid can alleviate discomfort, provide
                  emotional support, and prevent situations from escalating. Through first aid training, individuals gain confidence,
                   enabling them to remain calm and take decisive action when needed. Additionally, this knowledge fosters a culture
                    of safety and preparedness, equipping people to respond swiftly and appropriately in various settings. Ultimately,
                     first aid training is a valuable tool for promoting well-being, resilience, and community support.</p>

          <h2>First Aid for a Stopped Heart</h2>
          <p>When a person is in cardiac arrest (heart is not beating), doing CPR and/or using an AED could restart their
             heart and/or recirculate blood until their heart can be restarted with a defibrillator. This can restore their life.</p>
          <ul>
          <li>1. Find a person nearby. Make eye contact, point to them, and say: “Call 911.</li>
          <li>2. Start doing chest compressions on the person who needs help. Using both your
            hands, push down hard and fast in the center of the person’s chest. Let their 
            chest come back up naturally between compressions. You may hear pops or snaps; 
            this is normal.</li>
          <li>3. Keep going until someone with more training arrives. If you’re trained in CPR,
            you can use chest compressions and rescue breathing.</li>
          <li>4. If it’s available, use an AED. However, do not put off doing chest compressions
            to go look for an AED. If possible, instruct someone else to go find the device and
             bring it to you.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>First Aid for Bleeding</h2>
          <p>Capillaries: Bleeding from the smallest blood vessels (capillaries) looks like a trickle. This kind of 
            bleeding usually stops on its own.</p>
          <p>Veins: A consistent blood flow and blood that’s a dark red color is most likely coming from the veins. 
            This type of bleeding can range from mild to severe.</p>
          <p>Arteries: Arteries are the largest blood vessels and carry a lot of oxygen. If they are injured, bright
             red blood will spurt out. Blood can be lost very fast with this kind of bleeding.</p>
          <ul>
          <li>1. Put on disposable gloves if you have them. This will protect you from infectious diseases like viral
            hepatitis and HIV/AIDS that can be spread in a person’s blood.</li>
          <li>2. Rinse the wound with water.</li>
          <li>3. Cover the wound with a gauze or cloth (e.g., towel, blanket, clothing).</li>
          <li>4. Apply direct pressure to stop the flow of blood and encourage clotting 
            (when blood naturally thickens to stop blood loss).</li>
          <li>5. Elevate the bleeding body part above the person’s heart if you can.</li>
          <li>6. Do not remove the cloth if it becomes soaked. Removing the first layer will interfere with the clotting
            process and result in more blood loss. Instead, add more layers if needed.</li>
           <li>7. Once bleeding has stopped, put a clean bandage on the wound.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>First Aid for Choking</h2>
          <p>Choking happens when a person’s windpipe (trachea) gets blocked by food or an object. It is a serious event
             that can lead to unconsciousness or even death.</p>
          <p>Signs of choking include:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>1. Gagging, gasping, or wheezing</li>
          <li>2. Inability to talk or make noise</li>
          <li>3. Turning blue in the face</li>
          <li>4. Grabbing at the throat</li>
          <li>5. Waving arms</li>
          <li>6. Looking panicked</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If someone is choking, you should know how to use the Heimlich maneuver.</p>
          <p>Here are the steps:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>1. Stand behind the person and lean them slightly forward.</li>
          <li>2. Put your arms around their waist.</li>
          <li>3. Clench your fist and place it between their belly button (navel) and rib cage.</li>
          <li>4. Grab your fist with your other hand.</li>
          <li>5. Pull your clenched fist sharply backwards and upward under the person’s rib cage in five quick thrusts.</li>
          <li>6. Repeat until the object is coughed up.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>First Aid for Burns</h2>
          <p>First-degree burn: This kind of burn only affects only the outer layer of skin and causes redness and swelling.
            It is considered a minor burn.</p>
          <p>Second-degree burn: This kind of burn affects two layers of skin and causes blistering, redness, and swelling. 
            It is considered a major burn if it’s more than 3 inches wide or is on the face, hands, feet, genitals, buttocks,
             or over a major joint.</p>
          <p>Third-degree burn: This kind of burn affects deeper layers of skin and causes white or blackened skin that can 
            be numb. It is always considered a major burn.</p>
          <p>Major burns need emergency medical attention. Once you’ve stopped the burning process, call 911 or get someone else to.</p>
          <p>For burns that are not an emergency, you can take these first aid steps:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>1. Flush the burned area with cool running water for several minutes. Do not use ice.</li>
          <li>2. Apply a light gauze bandage. If the burn is minor, you can put on an ointment, like aloe vera, before you cover it.</li>
          <li>3. Take Motrin (ibuprofen) or Tylenol (acetaminophen) for pain relief if you need it.</li>
          <li>4. Do not break any blisters that form.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>First Aid for a Broken Bone or Fracture</h2>
          <p>Any injury to your limbs, hands, and feet needs to be treated as a broken bone until an X-ray can be done. While broken 
            bones or fractures do need medical treatment, they do not all require an emergency trip to the hospital. First aid steps
             can help stabilize the bone until you can see a healthcare provider.</p>
          <p>Call 911 if:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>1. The person is bleeding a lot, is unresponsive, is not breathing, or has more than one injury.</li>
          <li>2. You think a person has a fracture or other serious injury in their spinal column, head, hip, pelvis,
            or thigh. In this case, do not move the person</li>
          <li>3. A broken bone is poking through the skin (open or compound fracture).</li>
          <li>4. The area below an injured joint feels cold and clammy or looks bluish.</li>
          <li>5. You cannot keep the injury from moving well enough to transport the person.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Here’s what to do next:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>1. Do not try to straighten the bone.</li>
          <li>2. For a limb, use a splint and padding to keep it still, then elevate it.</li>
          <li>3. Put a cold pack on the injury—but not directly on the skin. Use a barrier 
            between the ice and the skin to keep the tissue from being damaged. If all you
            have is ice, put it in a plastic bag and wrap it in a shirt or towel before applying it.</li>
          <li>4. Give the person anti-inflammatory drugs like Advil (ibuprofen) or Aleve (naproxen) for pain.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>First Aid for Stroke</h2>
          <p>If you or someone else is having a stroke, the first step is to call emergency medical services. 
            Then you can perform first aid, such as CPR, if needed. Quick treatment can reduce the risk of death
             or long-term disability. You may also perform first aid after you have contacted emergency services.</p>
          <p>If you think you or someone around you may be having a stroke, follow these steps:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>1. Call emergency services: If you recognize stroke symptoms, contact 911 or your local emergency services
            or have someone else call for you. Stay as calm as possible while waiting for emergency help.</li>
          <li>2. Get them in a safe position: If you’re caring for someone else having a stroke, make sure they’re in a
            safe, comfortable position. If possible, position them lying on one side with their head slightly raised
             and supported in case they vomit.</li>
          <li>3. Check to see if they’re breathing: If they’re not breathing, perform chest compressions or CPR. If 
            they’re having difficulty breathing, loosen any constrictive clothing, such as a tie or scarf.</li>
          <li>4. Check to see if they are bleeding: If they are bleeding from a fall, apply pressure to the wound with clean fabric.</li>
          <li>5. Observe the person carefully for any change in condition: Be prepared to tell the emergency operator about their symptoms
            and when they started. Be sure to mention if the person fell or hit their head.</li>
          <li>6. Communicate calmly: Talk in a calm, reassuring manner.</li>
          <li>7. Prevent choking: Do not give anything to eat or drink.</li>
          </ul>
          <P>FAST:</P>
          <ul>
          <li>F - Face drooping: This can look like facial drooping, an uneven smile, or numbness.</li>
          <li>A-Arm weakness: You can ask the person to raise their arms and if the arm drops down or 
            isn’t steady, it could be an indicator of a stroke.</li>
          <li>S - Speech difficulty: Ask the person to repeat something. Slurred speech can indicate that the person is having a stroke.</li>
          <li>T - Time to call 911: If you or someone else is having a stroke, act quickly and call 911 or your local emergency medical services.</li>
          </ul>
