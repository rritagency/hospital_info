          <h2>Article 1</h2>
          <p>"Bangladesh sees 17 new Covid cases in 24 hours, no new deaths reported. 
            Health officials identify a new Covid variant. Total cases reach 2,050,028. 
            Recovery and death rates remain unchanged at 98.41% and 1.44%, respectively. 
            Daily case test positivity rate is 3.35% based on 508 samples."</p>

          <h2>Article 2</h2>
          <p>"Bangladesh's health authorities, including the Directorate General of Health Services
             (DGHS) and icddr,b, have issued crucial guidelines to mitigate health risks during a severe
              heatwave sweeping across the country. With temperatures exceeding 40Â°C in several regions, 
              the public is urged to take precautionary measures. The guidelines emphasize staying indoors, 
              avoiding direct sunlight, staying hydrated, and seeking medical assistance if experiencing 
              symptoms such as dehydration, severe headache, or sleeplessness. Vulnerable groups, including
               children, the elderly, and outdoor workers, are advised to take extra precautions. These 
               guidelines aim to minimize health risks and ensure public safety amidst the extreme heat conditions."</p>

          <h2>Article 3</h2>
          <p></p>"Air pollution, notably prevalent in countries like Bangladesh, is increasingly linked to rising 
          diabetes rates worldwide. Particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and ozone
           (O3) emitted from various sources are key pollutants associated with diabetes risk. Mechanisms such as 
           inflammation, oxidative stress, alteration of adipokine levels, and endocrine disruption are proposed to
            explain this association. Epidemiological studies support the link between air pollution exposure and 
            diabetes risk. While further research is needed, reducing air pollution could potentially mitigate diabetes
             risk, highlighting the importance of environmental policies promoting clean energy sources. The insights 
             are shared by an Associate Professor at the Department of Endocrinology & Metabolism, Bangabandhu Sheikh
              Mujib Medical University (BSMMU)."</p>

          <p>"Learn how to manage and prevent diarrhea effectively with key tips and guidelines. The article discusses
             the importance of hydration, ORSaline usage, dietary restrictions, and zinc supplements for children. It
              also provides insights on avoiding contaminated water and unhygienic food to prevent diarrhea. Expert 
              advice on proper handwashing and hygiene practices is highlighted for overall prevention."</p>

          <h2>Article 5</h2>
          <p>"Diagnosing dengue may soon be as easy as a home test with a '100% accurate' rapid antigen kit developed by
             Bangladesh Reference Institute for Chemical Measurements (BRiCM). Approved for commercial production by the 
             Directorate General of Drug Administration, this kit promises to detect all serotypes of dengue swiftly and 
             affordably. With no false reports to date, the kit offers a convenient alternative to hospital visits, potentially
              easing pressure on healthcare facilities and saving foreign exchange. Led by Mala Khan, a team of scientists has
               developed the kit, proven effective even for fingertip blood samples. Despite readiness for production, BRiCM 
               awaits orders from government or private sectors, while health officials express interest in promoting local 
               products pending due procedure."</p>

          <h2>Article 6</h2>
          <p>"Heart attacks remain the top cause of mortality in Bangladesh, despite a slight decrease in death rates compared
             to 2021. Contributing factors include lifestyle changes, poor dietary habits, obesity, pollution, and smoking. While
              treatment options have improved, prevention is key. Health experts stress regular checkups and awareness to mitigate
               risks, especially among younger demographics. BBS data highlights urban areas' higher mortality rates due to heart
                attacks, emphasizing the need for preventive measures nationwide. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), particularly
                 cardiovascular issues, pose a significant public health concern in Bangladesh and the South-East Asia region, urging
                  governments to prioritize prevention strategies."</p>

          <h2>Article 7</h2>
          <p>"A study conducted in Bangladesh reveals a significant association between smokeless tobacco (SLT) consumption and Chronic
             Kidney Disease (CKD). Led by Dr. Mohammad Habibur Rahman Sarker, the research involved 872 adults and highlighted SLT's
              prevalence among certain demographics, including older adults, housewives, farmers, and those with lower education and 
              income levels. The study underscores the need for education and awareness to combat SLT use and advocates for its inclusion
               in tobacco control strategies, given its cultural significance in countries like Bangladesh. Urgent measures are called for
                to address this overlooked aspect of tobacco control and mitigate the risks associated with CKD.""</p>

          <h2>Article 8</h2>
          <p>"Dengue outbreak in Bangladesh reaches unprecedented levels, with cases soaring to 321,179 in 2023, resulting in 1,705 deaths. 
            Children, especially under five, are hit the hardest, making up a significant portion of fatalities. Rising temperatures and
             rainfall fuel mosquito proliferation, spreading the disease nationwide. The outbreak strains healthcare facilities, forcing 
             repurposing of Covid-19 hospitals. Urban poor bear the brunt, facing job loss and financial strain. Efforts to control mosquitoes
              and prevent outbreaks require urgent attention and innovative approaches.""</p>

          <p>"Lung diseases are on the rise in Bangladesh, with COPD, asthma, and lung cancer becoming prevalent. Factors like air pollution
             and smoking contribute significantly. Recognizing symptoms like coughing, breathlessness, and chest pain is crucial. Preventive
              measures include quitting smoking, avoiding second-hand smoke, wearing face masks outdoors, practicing good hygiene, and getting
               vaccinated. Regular check-ups and staying physically active also help maintain lung health."</p>

          <h2>Article 10</h2>
          <p>"Pneumonia, a lung inflammation caused by bacteria and viruses, is a major global health concern. It particularly affects children 
            under five, with millions of deaths annually worldwide. In Bangladesh, pneumonia is a leading cause of child mortality, claiming about
             12,000 lives yearly. Various pathogens, including Haemophilus influenzae and influenza viruses, contribute to respiratory infections 
             in children, emphasizing the need for effective prevention and treatment strategies."</p>
